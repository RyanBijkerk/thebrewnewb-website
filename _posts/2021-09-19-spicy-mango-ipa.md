This is a first brew using a new kettle for a spicy mango IPA. This recipy is collected from the [Hobbybrouwen](http://hobbybrouwen.nl/){:target="_blank"} forum and created by [Ramon](https://www.hobbybrouwen.nl/forum/index.php/topic,39916.0.html){:target="_blank"} from 
[Milky Road Brewery](https://www.milkyroadbrewery.nl/){:target="_blank"}. It is an IPA using 5 different hops including fresh mango and Madame Jeanette peppers. This beer won the first price at the ONK (Open Dutch Championships amateur beer brewing) back in 2019, described as well balanced bitterness with sweet with a nice bite of the peppers.

To scale the recipy to the 10 liters [BrewFather](https://share.brewfather.app/uBb7GSyMzVQaiY){:target="_blank"} is used.

A small mistake was made in when ordering the hops so I recieved Amarillo leafs instead of pellets.

## The Brew
It's brew day! Excited to get started, and the first step is to crush the malts.

### Mash profile
The following mash schema is used:

| Phase | Temperature | Time | Ramp Time |
| :---- | :-----------| :--- | :-------- | 
| Beta-amylase | 62°C | 20 min | 0 min |
| Alpha-amylase  | 72°C | 30 min | 15 min |
| Mash-out | 78°C | 5 min  | 10 min |

As this is the first time using the new kettle, I'm not 100% sure how to ensure control the ramp time. So in this case I decided to ensure the temperature is reached, and at that point start the timer.

### Boil
The following boiling schema is used:

| Amount | Type | Name | Time |
| :----- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 25 g | Hops | Northern Brewer  | 75 min |
| 2 | Peppers | Madame Jeanette | 15 min (60 min\*)|
| 1 kg | Fruits | Mango | 15 min (60 min*)|
| 13 g | Hops | Simcoe | 10 min |
| 14 g | Hops | Amarillo | 5 min |
| 5 g | Hops | Simcoe | 5 min |
| 9 g | Hops | Citra | 0 min (Flameout) |

\* <em>My first brew I used a 60 min, which should have been 15 min, oops. See note below.</em>

There are multiple methods to add the mango, but in this case, I have decided to include them in the boil because of the following reason. I really want to use fresh mangos, but when adding them in the dry hopping phase you need to cook them to avoid any infections caused by the bacteria. To reduce this risk, I decided to include it in the boil. 

Now in this case I used the whole mango including the skin. Make sure to wash them thoroughly before adding them.

Now my gravity came a bit higher than expected, which is 1.080 SG instead of the 1.072 SG. This might be caused by the mango, but I'm 100% sure. If I'm correct, this will boost the alcohol to 8.9% instead of 7.7%. This is of course fully dependent on the fermentation process. Now I have decided the hour based on a Youtube video, but I did notice (a bit too late) Ramon has usually added both peppers and mango for 15 min.

### Dry hop
The following dry hopping schema is used:

| Amount | Type | Name | Days |
| :----- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 11 g | Hops | Cascade | Day 10 |
| 11 g | Hops | Simcoe | Day 10 |
| 9 g | Hops | Citra | Day 10 |
| 7 g | Hops | Amarillo | Day 10 |

### Fermentation
The fementation is on 20°C for 14 days.

### Bottling
To get the carbonation the secondary fermentation on the bottle method is used. A 7 gram a liter of regular crystal sugar is added.

## Notes
This recipy is also avaiable on [BrewFather](https://share.brewfather.app/uBb7GSyMzVQaiY){:target="_blank"}.

Note for my self, next time, ensure to use the hop bags or a hopping basket because the filter was clogged up. This is also needed for the mango.

Final gravity is a bit higher than expected, 1021 SG, which makes the final alcohol percentage 7.7%, which is exactly as the recipe described.
There was a clear taste of hops in combination with spicy flavors, which makes me very curious about the final result!

## Conclusion
The color is great, very bright orange but a little bit on the dark side with a nice foamy head. Overall I'm very happy, it is definitely fruity and you can smell the mango but I did find it hard to taste the mango. There is a nice spicy feeling to it, makes you a bit warm inside, and is not overruling. It is on the edge, so next time I would use a bit fewer peppers to reduce the spicy bite.

I did experience some white flakes in the beer, probably caused by leftovers of the hops or egg whites from the malt. So next time I need to ensure to filter better.
